## Stage 1 ‚Äì LC Opening (1-Aug)
**LC Value in BDT:** 100,000 √ó 120 = **12,000,000 BDT**  
**LC Margin (10%):** 1,200,000 BDT

```
Dr LC Margin with Bank       1,200,000
    Cr Bank Account                  1,200,000

Dr LC Opening Expense           15,000
    Cr Bank Account                     15,000

Dr Insurance Expense             8,000
    Cr Bank Account                      8,000
```

## Stage 2 ‚Äì Shipment / Documents Presented
```
Dr Goods in Transit (Inventory)     12,000,000
    Cr Bills Payable under LC             12,000,000
```

---

## Stage 3 ‚Äì Goods Arrival & Customs
**CIF Value:** 12,000,000  
**Customs Duty (10%):** 1,200,000  
**VAT (15%):** 1,800,000

```
Dr Inventory (CIF value)           12,000,000
    Cr Goods in Transit                  12,000,000

Dr Inventory (Customs Duty)        1,200,000
Dr Input VAT Receivable             1,800,000
    Cr Bank Account                       3,000,000

Dr Inventory                        300,000
    Cr Bank Account                      300,000
```

üìå Total Inventory Cost =
12,000,000 (CIF) + 1,200,000 (Duty) + 300,000 (Freight)
= 13,500,000 BDT

Per Unit Cost = 13,500,000 √∑ 5,000 = 2,700.00 BDT per bag
(VAT not included in cost if refundable)

    Cr Bank Account                       12,150,000
```

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Accounts Position After Closing LC
Once all stages are complete (goods received, all expenses booked, LC matured & paid), here‚Äôs what remains:

## Assets
Inventory: Increased by CIF value + Duty + Freight + other capitalized costs.
In our numeric example:
Inventory = 12,000,000 + 1,200,000 + 300,000 = 13,500,000 BDT
- Inventory: 13,500,000 BDT
- Input VAT Receivable: 1,800,000 BDT (if refundable)
- LC Margin with Bank: 0 ‚Äî it‚Äôs returned or adjusted upon LC settlement.

## Liabilities
Bills Payable under LC: 0 ‚Äî fully paid at maturity.
Creditors (if any clearing agent still unpaid): Could have a small payable if not yet settled.
- Bills Payable: 0
- LC Margin: 0

## Expenses in P&L
- LC Opening Charges: 15,000 (P&L ‚Äì administrative/financial expense).
- Insurance Expense: 8,000 (P&L ‚Äì if not capitalized).
- Exchange Loss: 150,000 (P&L ‚Äì due to FX rate increase at payment date).

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ LC Opening Charges ‚Äì Accounting Treatment

These are non-refundable bank costs for opening the LC (bank commission, SWIFT charges, stamp duty).

Normally treated as Finance Cost or Bank Charges in Profit & Loss.

Do not capitalize to inventory unless your company policy treats them as directly attributable to acquisition (some IFRS-compliant policies allow this if directly related to bringing inventory to present location).

In our example:
Dr LC Opening Expense (P&L)   15,000
    Cr Bank Account                15,000
This stays in the expense account and reduces profit ‚Äî it‚Äôs not in the final inventory value.

| Bills Payable under LC | ‚Äì          | ‚Äì              | 0            |
* Bank outflow = Margin (1,200,000) + LC opening (15,000) + Insurance (8,000) + Customs/Duty/VAT (3,000,000) + Freight (300,000) + LC settlement at maturity (12,150,000)
# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Key Points

LC opening charges = Directly expensed (Finance/Bank Charges) unless company policy capitalizes them.

After LC closure, the only major asset impact is Inventory (and VAT receivable if applicable).

All LC-related liabilities are cleared; P&L reflects only the non-capitalized charges and exchange differences.
